# Workflow
This project will produce a workflow in a Snakefile that takes the GTEx dataset and produces a series of boxplot corresponding to the gene counts of inputed genes in certain sample types. The first script, get_gene_counts.py, takes a file and gene name and returns all the tissue samples with the corresponding gene counts. The second script, get_tissue_samples.py takes a sample attribute file and the tissue type of interest and returns a file with a list of all of the sample ids of that tissue type.
